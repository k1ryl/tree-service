# Design process

**Design the data schema**: We can create a 'tree' table that contains a unique numeric id, a parent_id field that references the id of the parent node, and a label field that stores the alphanumeric label.

**Design the data model**: We need to design the data model for the application. We need to create a Tree model that corresponds to the 'tree' table in the database. The Tree model should contain a unique numeric id, a parent_id field, and a label field. We can also create a NodeDto model to handle the incoming request body of the POST /api/tree endpoint.

**Implement the service**: We can then implement the service that handles the logic for storing and returning the tree data. We can create a TreeService class that handles the retrieval and storage of the tree data. The TreeService class can use a TreeRepository class to interact with the 'tree' table in the database.

**Implement the controller**: We can then implement the TreeController class that handles the incoming HTTP requests and returns the appropriate response. The TreeController class can use the TreeService class to retrieve and store the tree data, and the TreeMapper class to map the data between the Tree model and the TreeDto model.

**Implement the database queries**: The final step is to implement the database queries that support the two routes that are detailed above. We can use the Spring Data JPA framework to create the repository interface that contains the necessary queries to retrieve and store the tree data in the 'tree' table.

**Test the application**: Once the application is implemented, we can write test cases to ensure that the application is working as expected. We can use JUnit and Mockito to write unit tests for the controllers, services, and repository classes. These tests can include testing the behavior of the service methods and controller endpoints when the database queries return different results, such as when a tree node is found or not found. We should also test the error handling of the application, such as when an exception is thrown by the service or repository classes.

It's also important to test the integration of all the components of the application, by running the application and making requests to the endpoints with different input and checking if the output is as expected.

### There are several ways to improve the performance of the application:

**Caching**: Caching the tree data in memory or in a distributed cache such as Redis can significantly improve the performance of the GET /api/tree endpoint. This way, the application can retrieve the tree data from the cache instead of querying the database each time, which can be a costly operation.

**Indexing**: Creating indexes on the parent_id and id fields in the tree table can improve the performance of the database queries. This way, the database can quickly search and retrieve the tree data based on the id and parent_id fields.

**Optimizing the database queries**: Reviewing and optimizing the database queries in the repository classes can improve the performance of the application. This can include optimizing the SQL statements, reducing the number of joins, and minimizing the number of queries.
